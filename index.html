        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Steph and welcome to my page. Firstly I would like to thank you for taking the time to view my page and as a treat I'll tell you a little about myself. I recently decided to make a major change in my career and so I'm surrently learning to code. This is probably one of the biggest challenges or rather wall I've ever had to climb but I'm determined to reach the otherside. I'm also an avid gamer, anime lover and a weakness for tech (too much tech some might say)lol!
            As a person I believe in putting my best foot forward and so I make a effort to learn from today about the things I didn't know yesterday. I'm very much a family person and will do anythiing for othrs, as long as its in my power to do so.</p>
        <p>Since I've told you a little bit about myself and we've got better aquainted, why not take a look at my future projects below:</p>

        <h2>2004</h2>
        <p>I attended Walsall College to study a GNVQ Double Award in Media and Communication. I spent two years at the Shelley Campus before moving on to university. During my time at Walsall College I was awarded the "Best Magazine Cover" award!</p>

        <h2>2006</h2>
        <p>2006 was the year I entered Birmingham City University formerly known as UCE (University of Central England). I studied for three years and during my time there, was mentored by British DJ Steve 'Smooth' Sutherland who worked for Chocie FM at the time and won an award for the "Best Radio Commercial". During my third year I was offered a job at Radio X FM, but unfortunately had to turn it down due to still being in my third year. I graduated with a 2:1 BA Hons Degree in Media and Communicatioon where I majored in Journalism and minored in Radio.</p>

        <h2>2010</h2>
        <p>I began working for various gaming sites writing reviews and game summaries, such as "Game Station", "Ultimate Gaming", and "Let's Game" before they all sadly shut down due to being unable to compete against bigger competitors.</p>

        <h2>2011</h2>
        <p>This was the year I started my gaming, anime and tech blog called Anigametec. I had a steady amount of followers and even got free journalism tickets to EGX, which was great considering I was such a small site. My blogging days came to a halt once I started a family, but it was never far from my mind.</p>

        <h2>2018</h2>
        <p>Marked the relaunch of Anigametec, but this time it was a website rather than a blog. I had a total of six volunteers and ran for two years before life caught up with me again and I eventually downsized and changed the name to "SwitchBite" which ran until 2020 as I could no longer maintain it due to work.</p>
